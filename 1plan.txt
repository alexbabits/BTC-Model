ML dumb --> 90%+ focus on coding professional traders minds into a bot.
ML can still give edge, more like a brute force method without intricacies of a trading strategy.
ML could be used to polish/ensemble with trading strategies. Combine forces.


QUESTIONS:

Maybe the more complex things for example don't one-hot encode moon cycles, you do it like halvenings with a count until the next moon basically?

HOW TO ADD FEATURES (LOG RETURNS!@#!@#, WICKS!@#!@#!@, moons, complex ones)????
(HOW DO LAGGING FEATURES WORK FOR MY DATA (My sliding window for DataY is already 1 step ahead))
So how would more than 1 day lag features work? Like I want a 5 day lag on something for example?
Log returns over 1/2/3/4/ etc days.

How would I weight prices closer to the closest day?
